When would you create a remote repository instead of keeping all your work local?
	When we want to keep a backup to all our commits on a server.
	When we want other people to contribute to our project.
	When we want a remote access to the project via cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because only you can tell when a commit is atomic and when i want to count any nnumber of changes as a singular commit.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Fork-
			To clone a git repository onto your github account which automatically creates a remote, so you don't have to run th command ;
			"git remote  add origin <http:...>".

			just clone it to your pc and push the changes : "git push origin master" after commiting.
	Clones-
			To download a repo. to your pc.
	branches-
			Various versions of the same root.
