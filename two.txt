What happens when you create a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

    When I create a repository, Git creates a directory vhere it will keep track
    of all the versions that I save.  Creating the repository also lets Git know
    that I want all the files in this directory to be tracked together, but
    separately from files in different directories.  If I didn't create the
    repository, Git could create the directory to save the versions in
    automatically, but it wouldn't know which files I wanted to track together
    and which I wanted to track separately.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    Staging area is the part of the git framework which holds on and keeps a track
    of all the changes made to the file before making a final commit. It then adds/
    loads the final commit on to the repository,instead of directly commmiting the 
    changes onto the repository. It offers a general sense of freedom by letting the 
    user be sure of what he/she wants to commit,and can make as many changes within
    a commit before sanctioning it.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

    We can make sure to have one commit per logical change by using staging area in a 
    way by adding each change that we think would constitute one logical change and can 
    keep on doing that till we feel that one logical change is ready to be commited and
    once we are done we can commit these changes brought to the files in the staging area
    to the repository.
